This project was developed to experiment with my full stack development skills, on top of my existing basic react and more advanced HTML, CSS and Javascript skills. This was achieved by:

- Creating interactive UIs with React
- Building and testing REST APIs with Node.js and Express
- Managing persistent data with MongoDB
- Implementing authentication and user-based functionality with Firebase
